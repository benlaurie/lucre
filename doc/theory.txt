I've always seen Chaum's anonymous ecash system described in terms of
RSA. RSA has this ungainly patent which probably will be around for
quite some time, yet the Diffie-Hellman patent expires pretty
soon. With that motivation, here's a Chaumian anonymous ecash protocol
based on Diffie-Hellman.
                     
Take a publicly known group G and generator g; breaking Diffie-Hellman
and taking discrete logs in this group should be hard. For instance, G
might be (Z/pZ)^*, the integers modulo a prime p.

The bank picks a secret value k, and publishes g^k.

To withdraw a coin, Alice picks an x, sets

                    y = x | hash(x),                [  | is concatenation  ]

chosen so that y is in G.  Alice chooses a random secret blinding
factor b, sends to the bank

                    A->B: y g^b,

and the bank returns

B->A: (y g^b)^k,

debiting Alice's account.

Note that this is a (blinded) Diffie-Hellman key exchange with public
exponentials g^k and y g^b; the bank returns the exchanged "secret".
                     
Alice unblinds this value, computing

                    z = (y g^b)^k (g^k)^{-b}

and now c = (x,z) is a coin in the digital cash system.  Note z = y^k. 
                     
We use the traditional online clearing protocol; to deposit the coin,
a shop S sends

                    S->B: x, z.

The bank checks to make sure the coin hasn't already been spent, and then computes

                    y = x | MD5(x),

checking whether y^k = z.  If equality holds, and the coin hasn't
already been spent, then the bank credits S's account and adds the
coin to the list of spent coins.

This is just the same old Chaum anonymous ecash protocol, except that
I've replaced the RSA operations by Diffie-Hellman ones.  It's a
lesser-known fact that you can blind a Diffie-Hellman key exchange
just as you can blind a RSA signature.
                     
The security of this protocol depends on the intractibility of
breaking Diffie-Hellman.  In particular, given public exponentials g^k
and y = g^m, for k,m unknown, it must be impossible to compute g^{km}
= y^k.

Furthermore, this protocol depends on the hash function being one-way
and possessing no interactions with Diffie-Hellman or modular
exponentiation.
                     
Comments?

---------------------

I have modified this original posting in a few minor ways.

Firstly, I used SHA-1 as the basic hash function instead of MD5. This
is extended further (see below).

Secondly, the value of the coin, x, is chosen to be in the range
0..2^n, where n = m+((log2(p)-m) mod 160. m is the minimum number of
coin bits, to avoid collisions (128 in my case).

The hash function used is defined as follows:

h[0](x)=x
h[k](x)=h[k-1](x)|SHA1(h[k-1](x))

x|hash(x)=h[(n-m)/160](x)

as should be obvious, this means that x|hash(x) has the same number of
bits as p.
