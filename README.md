==================================

What is lucre?
--------------

lucre is an implementation (in C++ and Java) of David Wagner's
Diffie-Hellman variant on Chaumian blinding. This variant is thought to be
unprotected by patents, however, you use it at your own risk.

For a detailed explanation, see [theory2.pdf][].

Where is lucre?
---------------

lucre lives at:

<http://anoncvs.aldigital.co.uk/lucre/>

The lucre code is available using [git][] or as a tarball.

The tarball snapshot is autogenerated from the repository HEAD. It can be
fetched from:

<http://github.com/benlaurie/lucre/tarball/master>

The git master repository lives at:

<http://github.com/benlaurie/lucre>

to check out a working copy with git, do the following:

    git clone http://github.com/benlaurie/lucre.git

this should create a directory called `lucre`, which will contain the
current source tree. At any time, anywhere within this tree, you can type:

    git pull

to get the latest versions and keep your tree up to date.

In case you are wondering what on Earth blinding is good for, the answer is
(at least): anonymous digital money and other untraceable transactions.
